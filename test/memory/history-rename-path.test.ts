/**
 * `task-097-memory-history-reads-each-commit-at-its-historical-path` — the two halves of the same
 * function seen twice:
 *
 *  - `bug-080-read-status-at-reads-the-current-path-at-pre-rename-commits`: the walk follows renames
 *    but `readStatusAt` asked `git show <sha>:<currentPath>`, so every commit older than a rename was
 *    read at a path the element did not occupy then and reported `from`/`to` as `null` (P1.10).
 *  - `bug-071-read-status-at-leaks-git-stderr`: that `git show` ran without an `stdio` option, so the
 *    child inherited the parent's stderr and git's `fatal:` went straight to the operator's terminal.
 *
 * Everything here runs against **throwaway fixture repositories built by this file**, never against
 * this repository's own history: a test reading our commits by sha breaks the day someone rewrites
 * them — which has happened in this release. The fixture reproduces the *shape* of the live case
 * (`a353c12` moved the Memory folder's `planning/v1/*`, then under the nested dogfooding root,
 * to `planning/rl-v1/*`, renaming five `release` elements at once because the `release` type's
 * `path` pattern interpolates the release-line id) rather than reading the live case itself.
