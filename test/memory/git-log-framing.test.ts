/**
 * `src/memory/git-log.ts`'s record framing (`task-086-fix-reason-control-chars-history-forgery`,
 * `bug-050-reason-control-characters-fabricate-history-entries`).
 *
 * The framing used to rest on a claim about *content* — that `0x1f`/`0x1e` are characters "a real
 * commit subject/body never contains". `--reason <text>` is arbitrary free text that lands in the
 * commit body (P1.7/P1.8, REQ-SEC-04), so that claim was false by construction: a `0x1e` in a reason
 * split one commit's `git log` record in two and made `wingfoil memory history` print a fabricated
 * entry whose `sha` was the caller-supplied text, while the genuine approval lost its `from`.
 *
 * These cases pin the framing against caller-supplied text rather than against a convention. The
 * guarantee the fix rests on is git's own, and the second describe block below measures it rather
 * than assuming it: **git refuses to write a commit whose message contains a NUL byte**, at every
 * writer down to `commit-tree`. That is why `%x00` is the separator and why the surviving TSDoc
 * claim is true (AC4) rather than aspirational.
