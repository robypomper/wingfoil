/**
 * Render + resolve a Memory-entry path (see {@link resolveMemoryPath}) **and enforce storage
 * confinement (REQ-SEC-06)**: the absolute target must be strictly inside the project `root`.
 * `path.join`/`resolve` normalize `../`, so a crafted `id` (or any placeholder value) containing
 * traversal could otherwise steer the write outside the managed, git-tracked store that REQ-SYS-01
 * establishes as project truth — this refuses that **before** returning a path, so no caller ever
 * writes outside the root.
 *
 * The boundary itself is {@link escapesRoot} (`./confinement.ts`), shared with every other store so
 * that "inside the project root" has one definition. It is asked **twice, about two resolutions of
 * the same path**, because a string and a filesystem answer different questions and a Memory write
 * has to survive both (`task-105`, `bug-117-memory-add-writes-outside-the-project-root-through-a-symlinked-store`):
 *
 * 1. **Textually** (`task-017`) — what the rendered pattern *says*. An ordinary `../` smuggled
 *    through a placeholder value is caught by **either** check, so that case alone would not justify
 *    keeping this one. What only this check decides is the **laundered** traversal: with a symlink
 *    outside the root pointing back into it, `resolveRealPathInRoot(root, '…/../../link/x.md')`
 *    reports `within: true` for a string that plainly climbs out of the project. The string is what
 *    the project declared, and a link that whoever owns the directory *above* the root can repoint
 *    at any moment does not get to ratify it. Pinned by `refuses a rendered traversal that the
 *    filesystem would launder back inside the root`
 *    (`test/storage/memory-path-confinement.test.ts`) — deleting this check reds that test and, of
 *    the 35 tests in the five suites over this path, only that one.
 * 2. **On the filesystem** ({@link resolveRealPathInRoot}) — where the write will actually land. A
 *    symlinked type directory puts the document outside the root with no traversal anywhere in the
 *    string, so the textual answer is "inside" and the write is outside; that is `bug-044`'s
 *    crossing in the store REQ-SEC-06 is written for. A filesystem answer exists even for a path not
 *    yet created: `resolveRealPathInRoot` resolves as far as the filesystem goes and keeps the
 *    missing tail verbatim, which is exactly this case — the document is about to be created.
 *
 * The second read resolves against the **working tree** rather than `HEAD`, deliberately and against
 * `command-baseline`'s general rule for a gating read. The argument is `task-102`'s, recorded in
 * `dl-086-a-guard-over-a-filesystem-effect-resolves-on-the-filesystem` (`in-discussion`) and not
 * re-derived here: what this predicts is where `writeFileSync` will land, and it follows the symlinks
 * that are on disk, not the ones a commit records.
 *
 * **The target's parent is resolved; its own name is not** — the asymmetry is
 * {@link resolveRealPathInRoot}'s contract (see that function), and it is the reason this returns a
 * path spelled under `root` **as the caller gave it** rather than under the real root: `commitPaths`
 * runs `git -C <root>` and callers take `relative(root, …)`, so re-spelling a legitimate path would
 * take it out of the repository's own vocabulary.
 *
 * Unresolved is not the same as unexamined, and on this path it could not be (task-106,
 * `bug-120-a-symlinked-document-leaf-is-followed-by-the-write`). Every caller of this function
 * writes — `writeMemoryEntry` (`../memory/entry.ts`) and `memoryAddFn` (`../core/index.ts`), which
 * resolves the same path a second time to guard it — and `writeFileSync` **follows** a symlinked
 * leaf, so accepting one put an element outside the project root and a `wf(<type>): add <id>`
 * subject in history for it. A third check therefore refuses a target whose own name is a link
 * ({@link targetIsSymlink}), without resolving it: where the link points is not judged, so the
 * `bug-044` case that keeps a symlinked file *removable* is untouched — that is a delete, and this
 * resolver serves no deletes. `dl-086` carries the baseline argument for both.
 *
 * @returns the absolute, confinement-verified target path, spelled under `root`.
 * @throws {@link StorageError} `E_PATH_ESCAPES_ROOT` (message: {@link CONFINEMENT_MESSAGE} plus the
 *   two spellings of the path, since the two differing is the finding) when the resolved path is the
 *   root itself, escapes it textually, or lands outside it on the filesystem.
 * @throws {@link StorageError} `E_TARGET_IS_SYMLINK` (message: `symlinkTargetRefusal`, shared with
 *   the transition verbs' `CoreResult` refusal) when the target itself is a symbolic link —
 *   including a **dangling** one, which `existsSync` cannot see.
