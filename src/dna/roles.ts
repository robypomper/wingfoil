/**
 * Role-based **directive binding** resolver (REQ-SYS-08, task-034-role-based-binding) — the DNA-only
 * primitives directive binding (P3.2/P3.7) and auto-load-by-role (P3.6) build on. Directives bind to
 * roles, never to named persons (ADR-006): every function here reads only the already-parsed
 * `DnaYaml` (`team.roles`/`team.members`/`team.agents`, spec-002-dna-yaml-schema) — never a directive
 * or workflow file — so reassigning a person's role in `dna.yaml` changes the resolved binding with
 * zero edits anywhere else (the REQ-SYS-08 Fit Criterion).
 *
 * **Approval routing is deliberately out of scope here** (`dl-033-canonical-role-resolver`, option b).
 * "Who holds this role?" and "may this principal approve?" are different questions with different
 * answers: AI agents do hold `developer`/`reviewer` via `team.agents[].executes_as` — correct for
 * directive binding — but never hold approval authority (ADR-006, REQ-SEC-03). The canonical answer
 * to the authority question is `src/core/approval-authority.ts` (task-040), which resolves the
 * approver from `team.members` by live git identity and never consults `team.agents` at all. Note
 * that `team.agents[].approval_authority` is **not** what grants or denies authority in code: no code
 * path in this tree reads that field — it is a declarative `dna.yaml` marker, enforced by
 * process/governance (ADR-006, CLAUDE.md §4/§8), as `approval-authority.ts`'s own header states.
 * BDD `p4-workflow/P4.14-approval-routing.feature`'s routing scenarios belong to `task-046-memory-approve`,
 * built on that module. Nothing in this file decides who may approve.
 *
 * No `CORE_MODULES` operation is registered here: this is the pure resolver later tasks (task-051/056
 * `directive assign`/role-based assignment) wire into their own CLI/MCP surfaces.
