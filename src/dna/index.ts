/**
 * `dna` module — Project DNA pillar; structured project map (P2.4). `dna.yaml`'s schema
 * (spec-002-dna-yaml-schema) lives here — the pillar owns its own independent schema (REQ-SYS-02);
 * `src/core`'s loader wires it through the shared validation pipeline. `./roles` adds the
 * role-based binding resolver (REQ-SYS-08, task-034-role-based-binding): `team.roles` is the sole
 * role catalogue, `resolveRoleHolders` reads `team.members`/`team.agents` alone to answer "who holds
 * this role today" — the foundation the Directives pillar (P3) builds on. Approval routing is *not*
 * here (`dl-033-canonical-role-resolver`, option b): "may this principal approve?" is answered by
 * `src/core/approval-authority.ts`. Further DNA behavior (`wingfoil dna show/set`, `wingfoil paths`)
 * lands in later tasks.

// over it (`./mutate`), and the comment-preserving structural edit that writes the result (`./edit`).
// `setDnaValue` is gone with them: it treated every path segment as an object key and created an object
// for any segment it could not descend into, which is the mechanism `bug-084` filed.
