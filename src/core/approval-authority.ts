/**
 * Role-based approval authority (REQ-SEC-03, adr-006-git-identity-role-based-authz —
 * task-040-role-based-approval-authority).
 *
 * adr-006's second point fixes approval authority as role-based, never bound to a named person: a
 * `.wingfoil/dna.yaml` `team.members[]` entry holds one or more `roles` from the canonical
 * `team.roles` catalogue (`src/dna/schema.ts`'s `Team`), and only a member holding the `approver`
 * role may approve a Memory document — uniformly across every type. There is no per-type approver
 * role anywhere in `memory.yaml`/`dna.yaml`: every `approval: { by_role: ... }` step across
 * `.wingfoil/workflows/custom/*.yaml` already gates on the single `approver` role, so this module
 * does the same rather than inventing a per-type mapping no spec defines.
 *
 * "Who is asking" is the identity `requireGitIdentity` (REQ-SEC-01, `./git-identity.ts`) resolved and
 * returned, handed in by the caller rather than read again here (`dl-064` B.1, task-132) — git
 * identity is WingFoil's sole attribution mechanism (adr-001/adr-006), and the transition verbs pin
 * that same value as the commit's author, so authority is checked against the exact "who" the
 * resulting approval commit records (`bug-149`). This
 * is why `team.agents` is deliberately NOT consulted here: an AI agent has no git identity of its own
 * distinct from whichever human account runs the command, so there is no code-level signal this
 * git-identity-keyed check could use to single an agent out. Structurally preventing agents from
 * holding approval authority is instead a `dna.yaml` fact (`team.agents[].approval_authority: false`)
 * enforced by process/governance (CLAUDE.md §4/§8: "AI agents ... never hold approval authority"), not
 * by this predicate.
 *
 * **"Who is authorized" is read from the COMMITTED `dna.yaml`, never from the working tree**
 * (task-090, `bug-079-uncommitted-dna-yaml-grants-approval-authority`). The two halves of the check
 * therefore take deliberately different baselines, and each takes the only one it can:
 *
 * - *who is asking* — the live git identity (environment, then config), a local setting git never
 *   commits, and exactly what the resulting commit records as its author;
 * - *who may approve* — `HEAD`'s `.wingfoil/dna.yaml`, because an approval is evidence and evidence
 *   is worth what an independent reader can re-derive from the artefact of record. An uncommitted
 *   grant used to be enough to put `Approver: … (approver)` into a permanent commit that the
 *   repository's own record, at that very commit, contradicted.

 * rejection (`memory.reject`, P1.8) proceeds. Returns a `CoreResult.error` (code `VALIDATION` — a
 * failed authorization precondition, mapped to exit `1` by `exitCodeForError`, mirroring
 * `requireGitIdentity`'s own precondition shape; `spec-005` §1 reserves `2` for a malformed
 * *invocation*, which none of these refusals is) carrying the exact REQ-SEC-03 fit-criterion message
 * `user not authorized to approve type '<type>'` when the git-configured email holds no `approver`
 * role at `HEAD` (including when it is unset, or matches no `team.members` entry at all); otherwise
 * `ok`. `typeName` is the Memory element type being approved (e.g. `task`, `adr`) — interpolated into
 * the refusal message only, it plays no role in the authority check itself (§ module doc comment: the
 * `approver` role is uniform across types).
 *
 * Three refusals, all fail-closed, all before anything is written:
 *
 * 1. **No authority at `HEAD`** — REQ-SEC-03's message verbatim. When the *working tree* would have
 *    granted it, a second sentence names the baseline, so a user whose editor shows them as an
 *    approver is told why the tool disagrees instead of being left to argue with the file on their
 *    screen. That diagnostic is the half of option (b) — refusing while `dna.yaml` is modified —
 *    worth keeping; the refusal itself remains a statement about the repository.
 * 2. **No committed `dna.yaml` at all** — an untracked file, or a repository with no commits: there
 *    is no record to read, so no authority can be established.
 * 3. **A committed `dna.yaml` that does not parse or validate** — the baseline is unreadable, which
 *    is not the same as "grants nothing", but leads to the same refusal.
 *
 * This function takes `root`, not a `DnaYaml`: a caller cannot hand it a parsed working-tree
 * configuration even by accident, which is what makes the committed baseline a property of the read
 * itself rather than of a precondition someone must remember to run (task-090, AC2).
 *
 * It takes the `identity`, by contrast, rather than reading it: the value must be the one
 * `requireGitIdentity` (REQ-SEC-01) validated and the one the commit will carry, and the way to
 * guarantee that is to leave this function nothing to read (`dl-064` B.1, task-132). Callers obtain it
 * from `beginMemoryTransition` (`./memory-transition.ts`), which runs the identity check first — an
 * unconfigured identity surfaces as REQ-SEC-01's own message, not this one.
