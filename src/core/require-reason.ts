/**
 * `--reason` mandatory-argument pre-flight check (REQ-SEC-04 — task-041-mandatory-reason-on-verbs).
 *
 * Decisions must be explainable in the audit trail: `memory approve` (P1.7) and `memory reject`
 * (P1.8) both record an approver/rejecter identity, an ISO-8601 timestamp, and a reason in the
 * resulting git commit body (P1.7/P1.8 BDD "the git commit records the approver identity, timestamp,
 * and reason"). The reason text can only be recorded if the caller supplied one, so both operations
 * refuse before any read/write when `--reason` is omitted — the argument-validation step every
 * mutating `CoreFn` already performs inline for its own required options (e.g. `memoryAddFn`'s
 * `--type`/`--title` checks, task-020), factored out here once both approve and reject need the
 * identical check (this task is their shared prerequisite, per its own Implementation Notes).
 *
 * This mirrors `requireGitIdentity`'s (`./git-identity.ts`, REQ-SEC-01, task-014) role and calling
 * convention: a mutating `CoreFn` calls it first, before any registry lookup or file access, so an
 * omitted `--reason` makes no change (REQ-SEC-04's fit criterion). Unlike `requireGitIdentity` (an
 * ambient precondition, not tied to a CLI argument, returning a `CoreResult.error` mapped to exit 1)
 * this is an ARGUMENT-shape problem — spec-005-cli-command-contract §1's "missing required argument"
 * case — so, matching `memoryAddFn`'s own `--type`/`--title` checks and `dnaSetFn`'s invalid-key-path
 * check, it `throw`s a `UsageError` (exit **2**, `./exit-code.ts`'s `exitCodeForThrow`) rather than
 * returning a `CoreResult`.
 *
 * `memory deprecate` (P1.9, task-048) deliberately does NOT call {@link requireReason}:
 * `spec-008-cli-grammar.md` §2 marks `--reason` optional "elsewhere (e.g. `memory deprecate`)", and
 * `P1.9-memory-deprecate.feature` has no "missing reason" error scenario (unlike P1.7/P1.8). Since
 * `task-072` it calls {@link optionalReason} instead of reading `options?.reason` raw.
 *
 * `task-072-fix-reason-trailer-contract` (`dl-067-reason-trailer-contract`, fixing `bug-042`) widens
 * both checks from "was a reason given?" to "can this reason be RECORDED?". Those turned out to be
 * different questions: `--reason ""` *was* given, was accepted at exit `0`, and left a bare `Reason:`
 * that made `wingfoil memory history` report an approval gate crossed by nobody, for no reason. The
 * shape rule itself is not decided here — it lives once, in `src/memory/commit-message.ts`, beside the
 * formatter that writes the trailer and consumed by the reader in `src/memory/audit.ts` (dl-067
 * clause 5). This module only maps a defect onto the CLI's usage-error exit code.
