Feature: P4.13 (US-1-02) - Workflow State Deduction (from Memory)
  As the system, I want workflow state deduced from Memory file existence and frontmatter,
  validated against the type's allowed states, so no separate state index file is needed.

  Background:
    Given an initialized WingFoil project with no ".wingfoil/state/" index

  Scenario: Deduce task progress from frontmatter
    Given a "task" file has frontmatter "status: in-progress"
    When workflow state is computed
    Then that task is reported as being implemented
    And the result is derived only from the Memory file, not a separate index

  Scenario: Deduced state is validated against the type machine
    Given a "release" file has frontmatter "status: releasing"
    And "releasing" is a valid state for type "release"
    When workflow state is computed
    Then the release is reported in the "releasing" phase

  Scenario: Error - frontmatter holds a state illegal for the type
    Given a "task" file has frontmatter "status: releasing"
    And "releasing" is not a valid state for type "task"
    When workflow state is computed
    Then the file is flagged invalid
    And the message is "invalid state 'releasing' for type 'task' in <file>"
