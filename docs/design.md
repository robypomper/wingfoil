# WingFoil — Design Pipeline Index (Lean Inception → Backlog)

**Purpose:** single entry point to the **documentary chain** that takes WingFoil from a
Lean Inception workshop to an implementation-ready product backlog. It tells you *where*
each phase lives, *when* it was produced, and *how information flows* between phases so the
traceability chain can be followed end to end.

**Last indexed:** (pending execution)

## The five phases at a glance

| # | Phase               | Location                                                                        | Index file                                                                                                                    | Produces                                                                        | Stop-Check                                                                           |

## Information flow (how each phase feeds the next)

The chain is **driven by traceable identifiers**. Each artifact carries an ID that the next
phase consumes, so any task can be traced back to the journey and persona it serves.

```

## Traceability chain (identifier lineage)

Follow an ID forward (vision → backlog) or backward (backlog → vision):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    PER["Persona<br/>(e.g. Alex)"] --> JOU["Journey<br/>(e.g. Journey 1)"]
    JOU --> FEA["Feature<br/>Px.y (e.g. P4.4)"]
    FEA --> US["User Story<br/>US-* (e.g. US-1-01)"]
    US --> SC["Scenario<br/>.feature (e.g. P4.4-workflow-next)"]
    SC --> REQ["Requirement<br/>REQ-* (e.g. REQ-PERF-03)"]
    US --> TASK["Backlog Task<br/>TASK-* (e.g. TASK-070)"]
    SC -- " acceptance_criteria " --> TASK
    REQ -- " Technical Task + related_stories " --> TASK
```

**Worked example (forward trace):**
`Alex` → `Journey 1` → feature `P4.4 workflow next` → story `US-1-01`
→ scenario `02_bdd/.../P4.4-workflow-next.feature` → requirement `REQ-PERF-03` (next-step
latency < 1,000 ms) → backlog `TASK-070` (User Story) depending on `TASK-058`
(`REQ-PERF-03` Technical Task).

**Reverse trace (from a task):** open `03_backlog/04_backlog/backlog.json`, read a task's
`ref` (feature or REQ id) and `acceptance_criteria_full` (path to the `.feature`), then
the `.feature` `Feature:` line names the `US-*` and `Px.y`, which the User Story Map maps
to a journey and persona.

## Note — Task management during bootstrap (dogfooding)

WingFoil is meant to **dogfood itself**: project tasks are ultimately managed as WingFoil
**Memory elements** (`type: task`) governed by the tool's own workflow and state machines.
However, that is not possible until WingFoil is far enough along to be usable.

Therefore the following transition applies:

1. **Bootstrap phase (WingFoil not yet usable):** development is driven by the **static
   tasks defined in the backlog** under [`docs/03_backlog/`](03_backlog/) — i.e.
   `04_backlog/backlog.json` and its `by-release/` slices are the working task list.
2. **Switch-over (as soon as WingFoil is self-hostable):** task management **moves into
   WingFoil**, with tasks tracked as project Memory elements (`.wingfoil/memory/task/…`)
   under WingFoil's own workflow — the product starts managing its own development.
3. **Migration of the remainder (if needed):** any tasks still open in the original backlog
   at switch-over time can then be **transcribed as WingFoil Memory tasks**, preserving
   their traceability (`ref` → feature/`REQ-*`, acceptance criteria) defined in Phase 4.

> In short: `docs/03_backlog/` is the **temporary, file-based source of truth for tasks**
> only until WingFoil can manage its own tasks; after switch-over, the authoritative task
> store is WingFoil Memory, and the static backlog becomes a historical/seed artifact.
