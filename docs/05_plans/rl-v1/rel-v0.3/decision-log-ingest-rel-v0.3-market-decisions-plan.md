## Context

On 2026-10-02 the approver ratified, in substance, six strategic decisions on WingFoil's
positioning, long-term direction and next features, and asked that they be recorded as
decision-logs. The request reached this session from another working session. They are captured
through `decision-log-ingest` (`.wingfoil/workflows/custom/decision-log-ingest.yaml` v1.0), during
v0.3's dev-loop.

Preconditions:
- the decision-logs are created with the code version (`npm run build && node dist/cli.js memory
  …`), not the pinned build: the published builds allocate wrong `memory add` ids on this
  repository (`bug-087`/`bug-162`, fixed by `task-128` after 0.2.2). The pinned build stays the dl-095 declaration
  (`npm run -s wingfoil -- --version` → `0.2.2`);
- each decision-log carries its whole content and cites only public sources, read 2026-10-01 or
  2026-10-02. Every fact it states about a public source is checked against that source at capture;
  every fact about this repository names the command or file that establishes it (`claim-evidence`).

Produces `docs/04_memory/design/dls/{id}.md` for each decision, in state `in-discussion`.

## Phases / Steps

1. **capture** (product-owner): one decision-log per decision, `memory add --type decision-log`
   then `memory submit` (`draft → in-discussion`):
   - `dl-140` — positioning, primary target and message (D1, D2, D5), with the roadmap order (D3)
     and the first-wave channels (D6) as its Consequences;
   - `dl-141` — long-term direction: no runtime of WingFoil's own (D4);
   - `dl-142` — approval of agent plans as a recorded transition;
   - `dl-143` — one generator for every agent's instruction formats. Recorded as a new
     decision-log that extends `dl-137` rather than as an amendment of it: `memory amend` needs the
     approver role, and `dl-137`'s open questions Q1–Q3 stay where they are;
   - `dl-144` — importers, OpenSpec first, then Spec Kit;
   - `dl-145` — the user guide's Integrations section.
2. **approve** (⛔ approver): `in-discussion → ready` for each, or `reject → draft`.

## Handoff

- **Approver:** ratification of `dl-140`…`dl-145`, and the final tagline wording (`dl-140`).
- **Agent:** capture and fact checks; the tasks follow at release-planning v0.4 (`dl-140`
  Consequences give the order).
- **Completion criteria:** `dl-140`…`dl-145` `ready` (or back to `draft`); this plan
  `active → done`.

## Execution Notes

- 2026-10-02 — **capture done.** Plan `add`/`submit` `4200157c`/`29b2f3e4`. Decision-logs, each
  `add` then `submit` (`draft → in-discussion`), code version:
  `dl-140` `56f1289e`/`1fd2f148`, `dl-141` `e173f74c`/`af376876`, `dl-142` `4a51700c`/`a01189c8`,
  `dl-143` `c6aec1d0`/`34a99dc2`, `dl-144` `03e70003`/`c0482904`, `dl-145` `eafd9422`/`4a878c91`
  (hashes before the rebase onto main; `git log --grep` on the id finds them after).
- **Fact checks.** All public sources were re-read on 2026-10-02. Corrections against the brief
  as received:
  - OpenSpec's monthly downloads are 2,317,591 (September 2026), not about 2.25M;
  - its "only checks that artifacts exist" is advice in a community-schema row; the general
    statement is the skills' "`status` is file-existence only";
  - Spec Kit's constitution lives at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`;
  - Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` only when there is no `CLAUDE.md` (relevant to `dl-137` Q1);
  - Agent 365 has no official GA page found, so `dl-141` does not rely on its date;
  - third-party migrators between spec tools exist, so `dl-144` says "no official converter".
- **Next:** ⛔ approver ratification of `dl-140`…`dl-145`, plus the final tagline (`dl-140`).

- 2026-10-02 — **ratification deferred by the approver** to the v0.3 retrospective or v0.4
  release-planning, whichever comes first. Release-planning's `reconcile-governance` phase
  (`dl-016`) sweeps decision-logs that are not `ready` into its scope, so `dl-140`…`dl-145` reach
  it without a separate reminder. This plan stays `active` until they are ratified.
