## Description

`memory submit|approve|reject|deprecate|history` and `dna show` act on the first operand and silently drop the rest with exit 0 (`bug-171`); commands with no positional accept any (`allowExcessArguments(true)`, `src/cli/program.ts:192`; `bug-131`). Per `dl-082` each command takes at most one positional; only `dna set` refuses today. One registration-level refusal covers all commands, including the workflow and agent commands A and B add.

## Acceptance Criteria

- (red-first) `memory approve a b --reason x` exits 2, writes no commit, and names the command and the count; the same for every command in `CORE_MODULES` with a positional (table-driven test over the registry, so new commands are covered without editing the test).
- (red-first) `workflow list x` and `directives list developer` exit 2 (`bug-131`).
- (characterization) `dna set`'s migration message is unchanged.
- (characterization) `spec-008` §1 states "one id per call" and that the multi-id subject form `{id1}, {id2}` is historical only; carried to the agent-facing docs through `dl-025`'s `align-agent-docs` phase.

## Implementation Notes

- **Size:** S · **wave:** 0 · **kind:** fix (`dl-133` Q1 (b)).
- **Implements:** dl-082 (one positional per command); spec-008 §1; spec-005 §1 (REQ-INT-04).
- **Features:** P5.1.4, P1.7.
- **Notes:** Proposal key: C04.
- Planned by `release-planning-rel-v0.3-plan` step 6 (build-backlog), 2026-09-30.

## Execution Notes

Branch `task/task-129-refuse-operand-beyond-command-declares-exit-2-before`, worktree
`../.wf2-wt/task-129`, cut from `main` at `6a28d281`. Start `a66f0439`; `bug-131` `[planned →
in-progress]` `38527912`; `bug-171` `[planned → in-progress]` `7fd5f629`.

### design (architect)

**`depends_on`:** none (`depends_on: []`), so no upstream Execution Notes to read (dl-015).

**Specs.** `spec-005-cli-command-contract` and `spec-008-cli-grammar` are `approved`,
`dl-082-cli-parameter-shape` and `dl-025` are `ready` (`grep -m1 '^status:'` on each). Neither spec
named a surplus operand. `spec-005` §1's exit-`2` row lists the malformed invocations and did not
list this one. `spec-008` §1 did not say how many `[args]` a command takes, and
`git show 6a28d281:docs/04_memory/design/specs/spec-008-cli-grammar.md | grep -c -i "one id\|historical"`
→ `0`. Both were edited by hand, each with a dated Revision note (below).

**Scope, measured at `6a28d281`.** `src/cli/program.ts` registers a declared positional as an
optional variadic `[name...]` and calls `allowExcessArguments(true)` on a command that declares none.
`src/cli/registrar.ts` passes the whole list to `buildParams`. Only `dnaPathPositional`
(`src/core/index.ts`, the four DNA path verbs) refused a second operand. `init` and `mcp` are wired
outside `CORE_MODULES` and already exit `2` through Commander (`too many arguments for 'init'`,
checked on `dist/`). They are out of the registry sweep.

**Where the refusal goes.** In `registrar.run`, after the `--format` check and before
`resolveRoot()`, so nothing is read or written and no operation check runs, the git-identity
pre-flight included (task-125's order stays intact). The four DNA path verbs are the one exception
the code has to keep. `P2.1-dna-set.feature` pins `dna set ..language python` →
`invalid key path: '..language'`, so the malformed-path check must come before the surplus check.
They declare `CorePositional.refusesExtraItself: true`, receive the full list, and refuse the surplus
themselves, after their path check. Both refusals use one composer,
`extraOperandsReason` (`src/core/registry.ts`). The DNA message is that sentence plus the hint
`the value travels in --value`, which keeps it byte-identical (AC 3). The registry sweep drives every
command whoever refuses, so a later opt-out that failed to refuse would fail the sweep.

**AC classification (T1).**

| AC | Class | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — `memory approve a b` → 2, no commit, names command and count; every command, table-driven | **red-first** | exit `0` and the first id approved today (bug-171) |
| 2 — `workflow list x`, `directives list developer` → 2 | **red-first** | exit `0` today (bug-131) |
| 3 — `dna set`'s migration message unchanged | characterization | the message exists; pinned byte-for-byte |
| 4 — spec-008 §1: one id per call, `{id1}, {id2}` historical | documentation | spec text did not exist (grep above), so this is a spec edit. No test is involved |

### red (developer)

`66f318d9` adds two suites:
- `test/cli/extra-operand-refusal.test.ts` runs in process over fixture modules. A surplus is refused
  with exit `2` and the exact message, and `resolveRoot`, `buildParams` and `fn` are never called.
- `test/cli/extra-operand-refusal.integration.test.ts` runs the compiled `dist/cli.js` in a
  throwaway `init --template scrum` repository with an approver and two `pending` tasks. It covers
  bug-171's reproduction, bug-131's two commands, and a sweep derived from
  `enumerateOperations(CORE_MODULES)`: one operand more than each command declares, with
  `HEAD` + `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all` compared before and after. It also pins the
  `dna set` migration message and `..language` characterizations.

`npx jest test/cli/extra-operand-refusal` → **20 failed, 9 passed** (29). The headline failure is
`Expected: 2, Received: 0` on `memory approve <a> <b> --reason x`. The 9 that pass are the 4 DNA path
verbs in the sweep, the two DNA characterizations, the vacuity guard, and the two in-process
"still reaches the operation" cases.

### green (developer)

`30dbe15f`:
- `src/core/registry.ts`: `CorePositional.refusesExtraItself`, and `extraOperandsReason(command,
  positionalName, given, hint?)`, which produces
  `wingfoil memory approve takes one positional <id> (got 2 positionals)` and
  `wingfoil workflow list takes no positional (got 1 positional)`.
- `src/cli/registrar.ts`: the refusal, before `resolveRoot()`, which calls `emitError` in the
  requested `--format` and then `exitWith(2)`.
- `src/core/index.ts`: the four DNA path verbs declare `refusesExtraItself: true`, and
  `dnaPathPositional` builds its message with `extraOperandsReason(..., 'the value travels in --value')`.
- `src/cli/program.ts`: the comment on operand registration now describes the new behaviour.
  Registration itself is unchanged.
- Tests that relied on the old acceptance were updated:
  - `help-positional-required.integration.test.ts` lost its task-120 AC 4 half, which asserted that
    an extra operand is *accepted*. That acceptance was bug-131, so the half asserted the defect. The
    header says so.
  - In `program.test.ts`, `registrar.test.ts` and `usage-error-dispatch.test.ts`, fixture operations
    that were given operands now declare their positional; the two DNA fixtures declare
    `refusesExtraItself`.
  - `program.test.ts`'s "declares no positional" case now asserts the refusal.

`npm test` → 163 suites / 2669 tests, all passing.

`e3ee2d4c` (docs):
- `spec-008` §1 gains two bullets, "at most one positional / surplus → exit 2, before any read, with
  the two message shapes" and "one id per call; `{id1}, {id2}` historical only", plus a Revision
  (2026-09-30) note. §2 was not touched, because task-126 edits it.
- `spec-005` §1's exit-`2` row names the case, plus a Revision note.
- `P5.1.4-cli-ux.feature` gains the scenario "an operand beyond the one a command declares is
  refused". The integration suite executes it and names it in its header.
- `docs/cli-reference.md` "Argument grammar" gains one bullet with the example. This file carries a
  user-visible behaviour change, and `test/docs/cli-reference.test.ts` stays green.

### refactor (developer)

| `npm run lint` | exit 0 |
| `npm run docs:api` | exit 0 |
| `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` | exit 0 |
| `npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --noEmit` | exit 0 |

### review (reviewer, self)

- AC 1: `memory approve <a> <b> --reason x` → exit 2 with
  `error: wingfoil memory approve takes one positional <id> (got 2 positionals)`. `HEAD`, the working
  tree and both tasks' `pending` status are unchanged (integration suite). The sweep covers all 18
  `CORE_MODULES` commands with no hand list, guarded by `COMMANDS.length >= 18`.
- AC 2: `workflow list sw-life-cycle` and `directives list developer` → exact message, exit 2.
- AC 3: `dna set project.name bogus --value y` → byte-identical migration message. `dna set ..language
  python` → `invalid key path` (the BDD ordering).
- AC 4: spec-008 §1 states it (`e3ee2d4c`). This task leaves the agent-facing docs alone. `CLAUDE.md`
  §5.1 still shows `wf({type}): {verb} {id1}, {id2}, ...` without the "historical" qualifier.
  `dl-025`'s `align-agent-docs` phase carries that (`grep -rln "{id1}" --include=*.md .` → `CLAUDE.md`,
  plans, and this task and its bug; no user doc).
- Same class in touched files: the `program.ts` operand comment and `ParamsContext.positionals`'s
  TSDoc both said an operation refuses extra operands itself. Both were corrected. `grep -rn -i "extra
  operand\|allowExcessArguments\|refuses an extra one itself" src test docs/*.md` shows no other
  stale claim.
- The MCP surface is unaffected, because its `buildParams` never sets `positionals`.
