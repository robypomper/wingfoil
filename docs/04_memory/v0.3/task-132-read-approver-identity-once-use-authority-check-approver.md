## Description

`readGitIdentity` (`src/core/git-identity.ts:61`) reads `git config`, but the commit is authored by git's own precedence (`GIT_AUTHOR_*` first), so the approved identity and the recorded one can differ (`bug-149`). `dl-064` B.1 gives this task the change: `requireGitIdentity` returns the identity and it feeds authority, `Approver:` and `--author`. The identity → prepare-transition preamble is copied in four verbs (`bug-142`), which is where the single read belongs; `isValidAttribution` accepts RFC 2606 reserved domains (`bug-153`).

## Acceptance Criteria

- (red-first) with `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` set to an address other than `user.email`, `memory approve` either uses one identity for the check, the `Approver:` line and the author, or refuses; never two (the rule chosen in design, stated in `spec-006`).
- (red-first) one shared preamble helper is called by submit/approve/reject/deprecate (and `amend` from task-127, `park` from task-180 when present); a structural test asserts no verb calls `requireGitIdentity` directly.
- (red-first) `isValidAttribution` rejects `.invalid`, `.example`, `.test`, `.localhost` domains.
- (characterization) `spec-006` states the order usage checks → identity → transition legality → authority, scoped to `approve`/`reject` (A.1), with a Revision note.

## Implementation Notes

- **Size:** M · **wave:** 1 · **kind:** fix (`dl-133` Q1 (b)).
- **Implements:** dl-064 A.1 (pre-flight order in spec-006, approve/reject), B.1; REQ-SEC-01; REQ-SEC-03.
- **Features:** P1.7, P1.8.
- **Notes:** Proposal key: C13.
- Planned by `release-planning-rel-v0.3-plan` step 6 (build-backlog), 2026-09-30.

## Execution Notes

### design (architect)

- `depends_on: []` — no upstream Execution Notes to read (`dl-015`). Inputs read: `dl-064` (`ready`;
  A.1, B.1, Review addendum, Scheduling addendum, Code addendum 2026-09-29), `bug-142`, `bug-149`,
  `bug-153`, `spec-006-core-domain-api` (`status: approved` — `grep -n '^status' docs/04_memory/design/specs/spec-006-core-domain-api.md`).
  `memory amend` (task-127) is registered; `memory park` (task-180) is not
  (`grep -n "fn: memory" src/core/index.ts` → add, history, search, submit, approve, reject, deprecate, amend).
- **The AC1 rule chosen (approver to confirm):** *use one identity*, not *refuse*. The identity is
  resolved once, in `git commit`'s own author order — `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, then
  `author.*`, then `user.*`, per field (git's `EMAIL` variable and hostname guess deliberately not
  followed: REQ-SEC-01 refuses an identity nobody configured) — and that value gates authority, fills
  `Approver:` and is pinned as the commit's `--author`. Consequence: with `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` naming a
  non-approver, `approve`/`reject`/`amend` now refuse; naming the approver, they succeed under that
  identity even when `user.email` is not an approver. This follows `bug-149`'s Expected Behavior/Fix.
  The committer stays git's own (the audit reads the author). `--author` outranks `GIT_AUTHOR_*`
  (verified on git 2.43: `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=env@y.org git commit --author "Pin <pin@z.org>"` → `%an <%ae>` = `Pin <pin@z.org>`).
- Order kept from task-125: usage checks → identity → transition legality → authority (approve,
  reject); amend's authority check stays right after its confinement check.
- `requireApprovalAuthority` takes the identity as a parameter (`dl-064` B.1: "a pure predicate"
  over the identity) — 13 call sites in `test/core/approval-authority.test.ts` updated.
- Scope: the non-transition mutating ops (`dna *`, `memory add`, `directive *`, `init`) still call
  `requireGitIdentity` directly and do not pin `--author`; they have no `Approver:` line and no
  authority check, so `bug-149`'s divergence cannot arise there. Listed as a candidate finding.
- AC classification:

| AC | Class | Why |
|----|-------|-----|
| AC1 one identity for check / `Approver:` / author | red-first | today `approve` with `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` set commits `Approver:` = config, author = env |
| AC2 shared preamble + structural test | red-first | `beginMemoryTransition` does not exist; five verbs inline the pair |
| AC3 `isValidAttribution` rejects `.invalid/.example/.test/.localhost` | red-first | all four return `true` today (`bug-153` repro) |
| AC4 `spec-006` states the order, scoped to approve/reject, with a Revision note | characterization | documentation of an order the code already has (task-125) |

### red

- Commit `a02f4ab7` — `test/core/approver-identity-single-read.test.ts` (new, AC1, approve/reject/amend
  × generic, refusal and env-approver cases, plus submit/deprecate author pin),
  `test/core/memory-transition-preamble.test.ts` (new, AC2: enumerates `CORE_MODULES` memory ops with
  `mutates: true` except `memoryAdd`, reads each `fn.toString()`; `park` joins by being registered),
  `test/memory/audit.test.ts` (AC3, 6 reserved + 3 ordinary domains), `test/core/git-identity.test.ts`
  (requireGitIdentity returns the identity; readGitIdentity precedence, checked against the author
  git itself records).
- Run: `npx jest test/core/approver-identity-single-read.test.ts test/core/memory-transition-preamble.test.ts test/memory/audit.test.ts test/core/git-identity.test.ts`
  → `Tests: 30 failed, 73 passed, 103 total`, 4 suites failed. The AC1 generic case failed with
  `Expected: "Env Author <env-author@example.invalid>" Received: "WingFoil Test <wf-test@example.invalid>"`
  (Approver line vs author) — the defect itself. The submit/deprecate pin passed (git already authors
  with env there): a pin, not a red.

### green

- Commit `56f08b2a`. `src/core/git-identity.ts`: `readGitIdentity` resolves in git's author order with
  ONE `git config -z --get-regexp '^(author|user)\.(name|email)$'` subprocess (was two per read, three
  reads per approval); `requireGitIdentity` returns `CoreResult<GitIdentity>`.
  `src/core/memory-transition.ts`: `beginMemoryTransition` (identity → `prepareMemoryTransition`) and
  `BegunMemoryTransition`; `commitMemoryTransition` takes it and passes `{ author: identity }`.
  `src/storage/commit.ts`: `CommitOptions.author` → `--author`. `src/core/approval-authority.ts`: takes
  the identity. `src/core/index.ts`: the five verbs call `beginMemoryTransition`; `readGitIdentity`
  no longer imported (`grep -n "readGitIdentity" src/core/index.ts` → nothing).
  `src/memory/audit.ts`: `hasReservedDomain` (top-level label only, case-insensitive).
- Same-class fixes: `makeTempGitRepo` commits as `wf-test@example.invalid`, so three audit tests that
  assert "every commit is valid" now configure `wf-test@wingfoil-fixture.org`
  (`test/memory/audit.test.ts`, `versioning-audit-trail.test.ts`, `git-log-framing.test.ts`); the
  global fixture identity is left as is (it is used as the approver email in dozens of fixtures).
- `docs/cli-reference.md` § Git identity: names `memory amend` among the approver-gated commands and
  states the resolution order and the one-identity rule.

### refactor

- `npm test` (as `npx jest --coverage`) → `Test Suites: 179 passed, 179 total`, `Tests: 3008 passed, 3008 total`.
- Coverage: Statements 98.82% (4383/4435), Branches 95.12% (2342/2462), Functions 94.34% (734/778),
  Lines 99.52% (3810/3828). `main`-equivalent baseline at `5b885fd5` (same worktree, before any change):
  98.82 / 95.06 / 94.44 (731/774) / 99.52. Functions −0.10pp: every touched source file is at 100%
  functions (`coverage/coverage-summary.json`: git-identity 5/5, approval-authority 5/5,
  memory-transition 8/8, audit 14/14, commit 11/11); the one newly uncovered function is the CJS
  re-export getter of `prepareMemoryTransition` in `src/core/index.ts`, which `memory-submit.test.ts`
  no longer imports through the barrel. Recorded, not hidden.
- `npm run lint` → clean. `npm run docs:api` → exit 0. `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` and
  `npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --noEmit` → clean. `test/docs/cli-reference.test.ts` green (in the full run).
- BDD: P1.7/P1.8 feature files unchanged (no AC asks for a scenario); their suites pass in the full run.

### review (self, reviewer)

- AC1 met: `approver-identity-single-read.test.ts` 21/21 with the preamble test
  (`npx jest test/core/memory-transition-preamble.test.ts test/core/approver-identity-single-read.test.ts` → 21 passed).
- AC2 met: the structural test enumerates five verbs (11 tests = 1 + 5×2), none calls
  `requireGitIdentity`/`readGitIdentity`/`prepareMemoryTransition`.
- AC3 met: `test/memory/audit.test.ts` reserved-domain cases pass; `dev@test.example.com`,
  `dev@contest.org`, `dev@company.testing` still valid.
- AC4: `spec-006` §7 + Revision (2026-10-01) written — a pending amendment, uncommitted (below).
- Unasserted (testing T1): nothing in the ACs; the committer identity is deliberately not asserted.

### Pending amendments (approver)

- `spec-006-core-domain-api` — new §7 (pre-flight order of the memory transition verbs; one identity)
  and Revision note (2026-10-01). Proposed `--reason`: "task-132: adds section 7, the pre-flight order
  usage checks, identity, transition legality, authority, scoped to approve and reject (dl-064 A.1 as
  corrected by its Review and Code addenda), and the one-identity rule of dl-064 B.1 that bug-149
  needed, as implemented by beginMemoryTransition."
- Merge order: `task-161` also edits `spec-006` (its §6) and merges first; this amendment adds §7 and
  appends a Revision note at the end of Process Notes — rebase onto 161 before running the amend.
  `task-138` edits `src/core/index.ts` (paths description) and merges first.
