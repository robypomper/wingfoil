## Description

The same procedure as task-236 for Codex CLI. This proves the adapter shape against a second vendor in the release that introduces it (North Star "different AI agents"). `grep -rniI codex --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git .` finds nothing about its flags in the repository today, so every declaration comes from its own help output and documentation at the `verified_with` version.

## Acceptance Criteria

- (red-first) The manifest validates as a built-in and is installed by `init`, pinned as in task-236.
- (characterization) By-hand verification of MCP registration, the `{role}-session` fetch with `element`/`state`, the lookups, and the record commit, recorded in Execution Notes with evidence. The same stop-and-return-to-approver rule applies.
- (characterization) An agent entry naming `adapter: codex-cli` in a scratch project runs one `agent execute` end to end. The run is recorded with `adapter: "built-in/codex-cli"`.

## Implementation Notes

## Execution Notes

<!-- Running log of what actually happened while working this task through dev-loop — filled in
     incrementally per phase, not written after the fact. Raw material for the release's Execution
     Notes / the retrospective, not the retrospective itself.
     - design: tech-specs found missing/needing revision (dev-loop/design safety net).
     - red/green/refactor: deviations from the plan above, blockers, scope surprises.
     - review: rejection reasons and what changed on the next pass. -->
